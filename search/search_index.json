Why facets-knowledge-panels? - Provides applications with a set of informative or actionable items which are contextual to a specific facet. - The primary goal is to allow high level contributions by users that maybe interested in a particular subset of the database, like a particular food category, a brand, a location etc. - We reuse the knowledge panel format, which remove the need for the application to change as the server side code change, or to implement specific business logic.
